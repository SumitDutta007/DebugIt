# Introduction
How would you feel as a kid if you could save lives by answering some fun tricky questions and become a Hero ! This is an attempt to do the same with some fancy cartoonic animations for the kids so that they can play and learn at the same time .

# How to run the game?
You can either run the game online at [LearningMadeFun](https://sumitdutta007.github.io/DebugIt-23/) or you can also clone this repository and then run `index.html` in your web browser or simply click the link in about section. The site can run in laptops , tablets or even in mobile phones and No need for any fancy installations!

# Tech Stack
* HTML to provide the skeleton for the web-page.
* CSS to provide the skin and visual appeal.
* Javascript to provide the brain.

<h1>Scope and Improvements</h1> <h3>(since nothing is perfect in this world!)</h3>

Running along with classes and exams approaching and the time constraint , I did my best but there are still things that can be done :
* Use `JSON` to store the name , score , class in `localStorage` as a Leaderboard tablet.
* Add various classes for kids studying in different classes along with other subjects added too .
